# COSI GRB Group Simulations

This repo contains the code and inputs for COSI GRB simulations, as well as other short-duration transients which will need to be classified and investigated by this group

'MEGAlib_backgrounds/' contain the large simulated background files for COSI SMEX. These will be generated by Andreas or Eliza separate from the signal simulation files. A signal, or a sample of signals, will be placed on part of the background files to enable a full simulation.

'MEGAlib_outputs/' contains the final output of MEGAlib simulations. These will be lightcurve, image (localization), and event files. These visualization files and event files will be useful for testing the GRB trigger, and in informing the data challenge. There will be subdirectories labeled by the sample runs that have come out, e.g. 'data_challenge_1/'.

'MEGAlib_source_files/' will contain subdirectories which contain the full set of source files passed to MEGAlib for a given simulation set. 

'MEGAlib_source_inputs/' contains the information necessary to generate a given simulation set in COSI. This is sub-divided into folders by event type, currently including gamma-ray bursts (grbs), magnetar giant flares (mgfs), soft gamma-ray repeater short bursts (sgr bursts), solar flares (solar_flares), and terrestrial gamma-ray flashses (tgfs). Each of these is further subdivided into the specific input samples generated by various team members. These will generally be spectral (.dat) and lightcurve (.dat) files, as well as relevant images (.pdf, .png, etc). Each of these individual samples should contain a text or catalog file describing the sample as well as the responsible team member.

'trigger_inputs/' contains the information necessary to test the COSI on-board trigger, generated by conversion of 'MEGAlib_outputs/' event files.
