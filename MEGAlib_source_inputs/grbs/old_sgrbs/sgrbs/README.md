# Short GRB Spectra and Lightcurves

This directory contains short GRB spectra and lightcurves created by Eliza. They are downloaded from Fermi-GBM, and the lightcurves were binned using Bayesian blocks. GRBs with T90 < 2.5 s and Band function or Comptonized best spectral fits are included, and the energy range for the spectral .yaml files is 50-10000 keV.
