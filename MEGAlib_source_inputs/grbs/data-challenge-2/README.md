# Data Challenge 2 Lightcurves

This directory contains the GRB lightcurves provided for Data Challenge 2. The long GRB (GRB080723557, GRB090206620, GRB130425327) lightcurves were created using Gabriele's source injector, the realistic short GRB (GRB090227772, GRB090228204, GRB101216721) lightcurves were created by binning Fermi-GBM lightcurves using Bayesian blocks using code written by Aaron and modified by Eliza, and the remaining short GRB (GRB080725541, GRB081101491, GRB081122614, GRB081223419) lightcurves were created with constant lightcurves.
